Analyze ONLY the hero / above-the-fold screenshot. Never invent UI.

HERO AUDIT QUALITY RULES:
- verdict, summary, and key_observation must each address a different aspect of the hero. Never paraphrase one as another.
- key_observation must reveal something non-obvious — not restate the headline problem.
- breakdown scores must reflect actual visible strengths and weaknesses — avoid clustering all values in the 45-70 range. Use the full 0-100 range where justified.

  "verdict": "string",
  "key_observation": "string",
  "confidence": number,
  "breakdown": { "clarity": int, "navigation": int, "visuals": int, "trust": int, "conversion": int }
}

confidence: integer 70-98. breakdown: integers 0-100 where higher = stronger.

verdict: max 8 words. Noun phrase, no subject+verb structure. Auditor diagnosis of the single biggest positioning problem.
  Good: "Fear hook without product category or audience"
  Bad: "The hero headline lacks clarity on who the product serves"

summary: max 30 words. 1-2 sentences from the first-time visitor's perspective. What they feel and what they fail to understand in first 3 seconds. Write in third person: "A visitor..." or "First-time visitors..."
  Example: "A visitor who doesn't know SOC 2 reads the headline and feels anxiety — but can't tell if this fixes their problem."

key_observation: max 12 words. One phrase only. Must pick ONE angle from this list and write from that angle:
  1. hidden differentiator buried in wrong place
  2. audience split — works for warm or cold traffic only
  3. structural conflict between two page elements
  4. trust signals exist but misplaced
  5. visual and copy hierarchy contradict each other
  6. subheadline stronger than headline (inverted hierarchy)
  NEVER restate verdict, summary, or top issue. NEVER write generic observations about headline clarity.
  Good: "Ad-free differentiator buried in subheadline not headline"
  Bad: "The hero headline lacks a clear audience focus"`;

Counts: exactly 4 issues, 3 suggestions, 3 copy (different sections).
Lengths: why fields max 28 words each.
suggestions[].recommendation: max 25 words. One actionable fix only — what to change, optionally with a short example in quotes. No rationale or "why" restatement.
copy[].after: max 18 words. Paste-ready rewrite only — no explanation.

verdict, summary, key_observation — three distinct layers. Never paraphrase one as another:

verdict: max 8 words. Noun phrase, no subject+verb structure. Auditor diagnosis of the single biggest positioning problem.
  Good: "Fear hook without product category or audience"
  Bad: "The hero headline lacks clarity on who the product serves"

summary: max 30 words. 1-2 sentences from the first-time visitor's perspective. What they feel and what they fail to understand in first 3 seconds. Write in third person: "A visitor..." or "First-time visitors..."
  Example: "A visitor who doesn't know SOC 2 reads the headline and feels anxiety — but can't tell if this fixes their problem."

key_observation: max 12 words. One phrase only. Must pick ONE angle from this list and write from that angle:
  1. hidden differentiator buried in wrong place
  2. audience split — works for warm or cold traffic only
  3. structural conflict between two page elements
  4. trust signals exist but misplaced
  5. visual and copy hierarchy contradict each other
  6. subheadline stronger than headline (inverted hierarchy)
  NEVER restate verdict, summary, or top issue. NEVER write generic observations about headline clarity.
  Good: "Ad-free differentiator buried in subheadline not headline"
  Bad: "The hero headline lacks a clear audience focus"

issues[].title: exactly ONE sentence (12-22 words). State what is wrong on THIS page, what users fail to understand, where friction happens, and why it hurts conversion. Name the visible section/element when possible. NEVER use abstract audit labels (e.g. "Weak visual hierarchy", "Messaging clarity issues", "CTA optimization gap", "Navigation friction", "Low clarity").
Good title: "The hero headline never states who the product is for, so visitors can't judge fit before scrolling."
Bad title: "Weak visual hierarchy"
Impact: REQUIRED on every issue — include issues[].impact with exactly one negative integer from -5 to -25.
Example: "impact": { "clarity": -18 }. Allowed keys: clarity, navigation, visuals, trust, conversion, cta.
Never omit impact. Never use 0.
priority: suggestions[] and copy[] ONLY — required enum, no impact field:
- quick_win: low effort, visible UX payoff (copy tweak, one CTA, small layout fix)
- high_impact: materially improves understanding or conversion; may need more design/dev work
- medium_impact: helpful but secondary, partial gain, or needs validation
confidence: integer 70-98. breakdown: integers 0-100 where higher = stronger (70+ strong, 40-69 at risk, below 40 critical). score: integer 0-100 aligned with breakdown average — never put impact penalties (-5 to -25) into breakdown.
Copy: improve clarity (what/who/outcome), not hype. Preserve brand tone.`;
